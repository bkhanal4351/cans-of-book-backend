# Start your own "Can of Books" App

This repository has starter code to begin work on creating your own online bookshelf.

## What can books do?

Books are life-changing. They have the power to enlighten, educate, entertain, heal, and help us grow. Build out this code base to create an web app to track what books have impacted you, and what's recommended to read next.

## Overview

We are making an application that tracks the user's favorite books and allows the user to make recommendations to the site.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->

## Estimates
<!-- See below -->

## Credit and Collaborations
<!-- Give credit (and a link) to other people or resources that helped you build this application. -->

## Logistical

- What hours will you be available to communicate?
  - 1-6 unless we need to finish an aspect of the site.

- What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
  - Slack is how we will communicate

- How often will you take breaks?
  - Hourly breaks as needed.

- What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
  - Reach out for help and check in each other about time management.

## Cooperative

- Make a list of each parson’s strengths.
  - Bishal: backend stuff, debugging
  - Ella: CSS, asking for help, staying organized
- How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?
  - Asking for each other for help and collaboration
- In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?
  - Bishal wants to get better at CSS and front end
  - Ella want to get better at Bootstrap and componentizing my work. 
- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?
   - Every day have a standup and check in to make sure we are on the same page about the code. 

## Conflict Resolution

- What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?
  - We have agreed to communicate with each other and be honest about weight that is being distributed. 
- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?
  - We're going to be honest and communicate. We will take time during our stand ups to make sure that is not happening.
- How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
  - We will approach each other with patience, understanding and encouragement. We will make sure we each understand what is happening in our shared code.
